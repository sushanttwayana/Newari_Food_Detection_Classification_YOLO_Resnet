# Newari Food Detection using ResNet50, YOLOv8, and Hybrid Models

ðŸ“Œ Project Overview

This project implements and compares three different models for detecting and classifying 16 types of traditional Newari food items from images:

YOLOv8-only â€“ Real-time object detection.

ResNet50-only â€“ High-accuracy food classification.

Hybrid (YOLOv8 + ResNet50) â€“ Combines the speed of YOLO with the accuracy of ResNet for improved results, especially in complex or overlapping food scenes.

ðŸ§  Objective

Detect multiple food items in an image.

Accurately classify food categories: e.g., Yomari, Bara, Chatamari, Achar, etc.

Evaluate and compare models using standard metrics: Precision, Recall, F1-score, mAP, and IoU.

Handle challenges like overlapping objects, small food items, and similar-looking dishes.

ðŸ§± Model Architectures

ðŸ”¹ YOLOv8-only (Object Detection)
Fast and efficient object detection in a single forward pass.

Performs well in localizing objects but struggles with fine-grained classification in overlapping objects.

ðŸ”¹ ResNet50-only (Image Classification)
Deep CNN trained to classify an entire image into one food category.

Excels in identifying subtle differences between food items but lacks localization.

ðŸ”¹ Hybrid (ResNet50 + YOLOv8)
ResNet50: Used as a high-level feature extractor or classifier to guide YOLO.

YOLOv8: Performs object localization, with added context from ResNet to handle overlapping or ambiguous scenes.

Best performance for real-world complex food images.
